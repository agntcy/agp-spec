                      draft-muscariello-agp-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies the Agent Gateway Protocol (AGP), a protocol
   designed to support real-time interactive AI applications at scale.
   AGP extends gRPC with publish-subscribe capabilities to enable
   efficient many-to-many communication patterns between AI agents.  The
   protocol provides mechanisms for connection management, stream
   multiplexing, and flow control while maintaining compatibility with
   existing gRPC deployments.

1.  Introduction

   As AI systems become more sophisticated and interconnected, there is
   a growing need for protocols that can support real-time interactive
   applications at scale.  The Agent Gateway Protocol (AGP) addresses
   this need by:

   *  Extending gRPC with publish-subscribe patterns

   *  Supporting bidirectional streaming between agents

   *  Enabling efficient many-to-many communication

   *  Maintaining backward compatibility with gRPC

1.1.  Protocol Overview

   AGP builds on gRPC's core features while adding:

   *  Native support for pub/sub messaging patterns

   *  Enhanced stream multiplexing capabilities

   *  Real-time event notification system

   *  Dynamic topic creation and management

2.  Architecture

2.1.  Protocol Layers

        +-------------------+
        |     Application   |
        +-------------------+
        |   AGP Services    |
        +-------------------+
        |     Pub/Sub      |

2.2.  Core Components

   *  Gateway Nodes: Handle routing and message distribution

   *  Topics: Named channels for pub/sub communication

   *  Streams: Bidirectional communication channels

   *  Services: Application-specific RPC definitions

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Security Considerations

   The Agent Gateway Protocol (AGP) relies on the Messaging Layer
   Security (MLS) protocol to provide end-to-end security for group
   communications between agents.

4.1.  MLS Integration

   AGP uses MLS for the following security properties:

   *  End-to-end encryption for all agent communications

   *  Forward secrecy and post-compromise security

   *  Group key management and membership changes

   *  Scalable group messaging security

4.2.  Authentication and Identity

   Each agent MUST:

   *  Maintain cryptographic identities compatible with MLS

   *  Use certified credentials for initial authentication

   *  Validate peer credentials during connection establishment

   *  Support credential revocation and rotation

4.3.  Group Security

   MLS provides the following guarantees for agent groups:

   *  Continuous group key updates

   *  Secure member addition and removal

   *  Protection against message forgery

   *  Perfect forward secrecy for all messages

4.4.  Transport Security

   All AGP connections MUST use:

   *  TLS 1.3 or higher for transport security

   *  Strong cipher suites as defined in TLS 1.3

   *  Certificate-based authentication

   *  Perfect forward secrecy

4.5.  Operational Security

   Implementations MUST:

   *  Maintain secure key storage

   *  Support MLS epoch advancement

   *  Implement proper credential management

   *  Monitor for security events

   *  Support secure group state recovery

4.6.  Privacy Considerations

   AGP with MLS provides:

   *  Metadata protection

   *  Group membership privacy

   *  Participant anonymity options

   *  Traffic analysis resistance

4.7.  Implementation Requirements

   Implementations MUST NOT:

   *  Use non-MLS encryption schemes

   *  Support downgrades to less secure modes

   *  Allow plaintext communication

   *  Skip credential verification
